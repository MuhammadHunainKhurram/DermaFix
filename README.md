# DermaFix
We are an application targeted towards those who cannot afford to seek a dermatologist. DermaFix will ask the patient to upload an image of a skin issue that
concerns them, and we will provide a diagnosis and over-the-counter remedies first, before recommending a doctor. If the picture uploaded appears serious, we 
will recommend that the patient seek medical care.
